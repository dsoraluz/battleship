#Ramdom Access Memory: a game to excersize the mind.

This game is the result of an botched attempt to re-create the classic board game: Battleship.

A game that I like to call "Random Access Memory" came is what was created.

Premise: A game where the player is briefly flashed a random arrangement of 10 tiles and then is given the chance to uncover them on a where all of therm are hidden.

Difficulty: As the player clears the levels and progresses to the next, the margin of error to uncover all of the tiles decreases.

Level 1:
- Arrangement is flashed for 3.5 seconds.
- 25 tries
- 10 tiles

Level 2:
- Arrangement is flashed for 3.0 seconds.
- 20 tries
- 10 tiles

Level 3:
- Arrangement is flashed for 2.5 seconds.
- 18 tries
- 10 tiles

Level 4:
- Arrangement is flashed for 2.0 seconds.
- 15 tries
- 10 tiles

Level 5:
- Arrangement is flashed for 1.5 seconds.
- 12 tries
- 10 tiles

This was all built using HTML, CSS, and DOM Manipulation using JQuery.
